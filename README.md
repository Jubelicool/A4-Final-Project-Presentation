## Step-by-step guide


## Future work
If we had more time to develope on the script, we would have collected the specific wall areas and the specific room geometry. As it is now, we assume that every room is quadratic. Thus, the script calculates the total wall area of the room with the room area and the room height as input. This method is okay since we use Sabine's equation to determine the reverberation time which doesn't take in the room geometry but only uses the absorption area and volume of the room, and since the surface material of all the walls is plasterboard. Acoustics will, however, be affected based on whether the walls are parallel or not, but this will not be considered at this level.
